# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
The **IPL Data Analysis** project aims to extract valuable insights from IPL match data using data analytics techniques. By analyzing historical match outcomes, player performances, team comparisons, and venue statistics, the project visualizes trends and patterns through interactive graphs like bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.

With Python’s powerful libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, this project provides a comprehensive overview of IPL data for **in-depth analysis and decision-making**.
